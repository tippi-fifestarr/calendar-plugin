## Bro Book Me : My Calendar
Dework link instead of github project.

This calendar can be used in BroFundMe to broadcast a meeting between the booker and the booked, with the time and place.  It will be wrapped in a form handler that I'd like to play around with called Formik, also known as react-hook-form.

> we are looking for bro's to do "user experience interviews" and will give you +1 bro points for your time!

# Getting Started with Create React App

> this project uses --legacy-peer-deps to install react-datepicker

https://remotestack.io/react-calendar-datepicker-and-timepicker-tutorial/

This project was bootstrapped with bootstrap and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Roadmap
> teamies: vote by adding your name below and ": yay" or ": nay"

Hexagon shape has six sides.  Original hourCoin NFT is a golden hexagon coin rotating in blender.  For each one bought by a bro funder, there are 5 more given to bro getting funded.  These six are all simultaneously randomized by the Chainlinks, applying the layers of quality to the 3d dynamic and randomly seeded NFT.
